The following are the main advantages of exception handling over traditional error handling:

1. Separation of Error Handling Code from Normal Code:-------------

There are always if-else conditions to handle errors in traditional error handling codes. 
These conditions and the code to handle errors get mixed up with the normal flow. This makes the code less readable and maintainable.
 With try/catch blocks, the code for error handling becomes separate from the normal flow.

2. Grouping of Error Types:------------

In C++, both basic types and objects can be thrown as exceptions.
We can  categorize them according to their types.

Examples of Exception Handling in C++:---

We will see in practical session:

We need to add #include <exception>   header file for using predefined exceptions.
